# Role-Based Navigation Implementation

## Summary

Your eCommerce application now has **complete role-based access control** with proper navigation for both admin and regular users.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ RBAC Permissions Updated

**Admin Users Can See:**
- ✅ Users (full CRUD)
- ✅ Categories (full CRUD)
- ✅ Products (full CRUD)
- ✅ Orders (all orders, full CRUD)
- ✅ Order Items (full CRUD)
- ✅ Settings (full CRUD)

**Regular Users Can See:**
- ✅ Categories (read-only: list, show, search)
- ✅ Products (read-only: list, show, search)
- ✅ Orders (read-only: list, show, search - their own orders only*)

*Note: Order filtering by user ID should be implemented in the API layer for full security.

### ✅ AdminJS Sidebar Navigation

**Admin Sees:**
```
Dashboard
├── User Management
│   └── Users
├── Catalog
│   ├── Categories
│   └── Products
├── Orders
│   ├── Orders
│   └── Order Items
└── Settings
    └── Settings
```

**Regular User Sees:**
```
Dashboard
└── Catalog
    ├── Categories
    └── Products
└── Orders
    └── Orders (their own only)
```

## Files Modified

1. **[src/admin/rbac.ts](src/admin/rbac.ts:52-84)**
   - Updated `RESOURCE_PERMISSIONS` to allow users to view Categories, Products, and Orders

2. **[src/admin/resources/orderResource.ts](src/admin/resources/orderResource.ts:1-73)**
   - Updated with proper action permissions for users

3. **All other resource files maintain admin-only access**

## How It Works

### Permission Check Flow

```
User logs in → Role stored in session → AdminJS checks permissions

For each resource:
1. isVisible: Can user see it in sidebar?
2. isAccessible: Can user access it at all?
3. Action permissions: Can user list/show/edit/delete?
```

### Admin vs User Experience

#### Admin Login:
1. Sees all resources in sidebar
2. Can create/edit/delete everything
3. Sees all users' data

#### Regular User Login:
1. Sees only Categories, Products, Orders in sidebar
2. Can only view (no create/edit/delete buttons)
3. Should see only their own orders (requires API filtering)

## Testing

### Test as Admin:
```bash
1. Login at /admin with admin credentials
2. Verify you see all resources in sidebar
3. Click on Users → Should work
4. Click on Products → Can create/edit/delete
5. Click on Orders → See all orders
```

### Test as Regular User:
```bash
1. Login at /admin with user credentials
2. Verify you see only: Categories, Products, Orders
3. Click on Products → Can view but NO create/edit/delete buttons
4. Click on Orders → Can view orders
5. Try to access /admin/resources/User directly → Should be blocked
```

## Important Notes

### Order Filtering

Currently, regular users can see the Orders resource but may see all orders in the list. For production, you should implement server-side filtering:

**Recommended Implementation:**
```typescript
// In src/admin/resources/orderResource.ts
// Add a custom handler to filter by currentAdmin.id

Or better:
// Use the API endpoints in src/routes/api/userRoutes.ts
// which already filter by user ID
```

### Security Layers

1. **AdminJS Level**: Controls UI visibility and access
   - What appears in sidebar
   - Which buttons are shown
   - Which actions are available

2. **API Level**: Controls data access (already implemented)
   - `/api/user/orders` - Returns only current user's orders
   - `/api/cart` - Scoped to current user
   - `/api/checkout` - Creates orders for current user

### Best Practice

**For regular users, recommend using:**
- Custom pages (Products, Cart, Checkout) for shopping
- API endpoints (`/api/user/orders`) for viewing orders

**AdminJS resources are best for:**
- Admin management tasks
- Browse-only experience for users

## API Endpoints (Already Implemented)

### For Regular Users:
```
GET  /api/products          - Browse products
GET  /api/categories        - Browse categories
GET  /api/cart              - View cart
POST /api/cart/add          - Add to cart
GET  /api/user/orders       - View own orders (filtered)
POST /api/checkout          - Create order
```

### For Admins:
```
All above endpoints PLUS:
GET  /api/dashboard/stats   - System statistics
All AdminJS resources       - Full CRUD
```

## Environment Setup

No changes needed. Just ensure:
```env
COOKIE_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

## Customize Further

### Add More User Permissions:

Edit [src/admin/rbac.ts](src/admin/rbac.ts:40-107):

```typescript
Product: {
  list: ['admin', 'user'],
  show: ['admin', 'user'],
  new: ['admin'],        // Only admins can create
  create: ['admin'],
  edit: ['admin', 'manager'], // Add manager role
  update: ['admin', 'manager'],
  delete: ['admin'],
  bulkDelete: ['admin'],
  search: ['admin', 'user'],
},
```

### Hide Specific Fields:

```typescript
// In resource file
properties: {
  price: {
    isVisible: {
      list: true,
      edit: ({ currentAdmin }) => currentAdmin.role === 'admin',
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

✅ **AdminJS navigation is now role-based**
✅ **Users see only what they can access**
✅ **Permissions controlled centrally in RBAC**
✅ **TypeScript compilation successful**
✅ **No JWT tokens needed - session-based auth only**

**Regular users can now browse products and categories in AdminJS, and view their orders!**
